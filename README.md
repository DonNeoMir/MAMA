## Usage
See I told you, its already more awesome(r)
### Creating the Students Wishlist
The Wishlist includes identifications of the Students (Names, Matrikel-Nr. or something like it), identifications of the advanced modules (Names, Number or something like it), the max. number of students which can be assigned to the particular module and the grade which is used to priorities the students. These informations have to be saved in a comma separated table formatted as seen in the *example PDF* and the *example csv*. The following points have to be considered while creating the *.csv* file (Create in a spreadsheet program like EXCLE and then save/export as csv (Comma separated values)).
* Blue Cells (see *example PDF*) must be empty
* Priorities must be integers in the range between 1 and the number of Modules.
* The max. size of Students per module must be an integer.
* The grade must be an integer in the range between 1 and 100
* ?? Neither the Students nor the modules should include a space (e.g. use underscore instead)
